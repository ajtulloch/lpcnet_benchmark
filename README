To compile, just run: 
./compile.sh

to execute, run:
./test_lpcnet features.f32 output.sw

where output.sw can be replaced with /dev/null. The features.f32 file contains
32-bit IEEE float data in little endian format, but test_lpcnet does not
compensate for endianness, so it won't work on big endian machines (just
rearranging all of features.f32 should work).

To check that the output is correct, play it with:
aplay -r 16000 -c 1 -f S16_LE output.sw

The features.f32 file can be concatenated with itself to make it longer.
The running time on a Broadwell E5-2640 v4 is 21.4 seconds.
